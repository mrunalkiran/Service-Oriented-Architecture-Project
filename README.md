# Metasearch Engine – FuseFind

## Description

FuseFind is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)–based metasearch engine that enables real-time comparison of responses from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) using a single query.

The system integrates independent AI services such as OpenAI, Claude, Groq, and Ollama (local inference), orchestrating them through a centralized backend to deliver aggregated results via a clean, user-friendly interface. Each service operates independently, ensuring loose coupling, fault isolation, and scalability.

This project demonstrates practical system design skills, including service orchestration, API integration, parallel request handling, and extensible architecture. FuseFind highlights how modern distributed systems can be built to remain vendor-agnostic while supporting both cloud-based and local AI models.

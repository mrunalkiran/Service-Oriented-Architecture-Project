# Metasearch Engine – FuseFind

## Description

FuseFind is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)–based metasearch engine that allows users to submit a single query and compare responses from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) through a unified interface.

The system integrates multiple independent AI services, including OpenAI, Claude, Groq, and Ollama (local inference). Each model functions as a loosely coupled service, while a centralized backend orchestrator handles request distribution, response aggregation, and optional audio generation.

FuseFind demonstrates key SOA principles such as loose coupling, reusability, fault isolation, scalability, and interoperability. It enables real-time, side-by-side comparison of LLM responses and supports both text and audio outputs, making it a practical example of modern service-oriented system design.
